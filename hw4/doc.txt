Alright, so a few points:

First, vertices must be specified in clockwise order.  Otherwise, the polygon will not give proper collision times.

Second, if no number of reflections are specified, the simulation will go on forever.

Third, a very abnormal problem with the angle of reflection occurs if we try to bounce off the outside of the
arena.  At that point, the angle of reflection takes the line on a straight line INTO the arena, where it proceeds to 
behave normally.  This is reminiscient of a problem I had earlier with the angle of reflection when bouncing off the 
OUTSIDE of shapes.  In order to avert that problem, I did a round when returning the collision time.  It is possible that this 
round is occuring the wrong way when the ray bounces off the outside of the arena, which may be causing my problems.

Other than that, I know of no problems with this simulation.
